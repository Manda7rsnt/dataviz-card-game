The Dataviz Card Game projects intends to create physical game cards as a support of knowledge transfer on the theme of data visualization. The Dataviz Card Game has been prototyped by Cédric Lombion in 2014, and has since become a project under the banner of Ecole des données. The work on the project has been partially financed by School of Data's innovation fund.
