**Name**: Dataviz Exploration

**Narrative**: The Dataviz exploration workshop, with the help of the Dataviz Card Game designed by Ecole des données, walks you through core datavisualisation concepts and widens your knowledge about existing datavisualisations and their uses.

**Audience**: Dataviz beginners

**Goals**:

* Learn about the various existing dataviz
* Learn about the thinking process to use visualize data
* Learn about key datavisualisations

**Minimum required time**: 120 minutes

**Already tested?** Yes

* Istanbul
* Paris

**Ideal number of participants:** 2-12, working in groups of 4 maximum

**Number of facilitators**: 1-2

**Required material for the facilitator**:

* Dataviz Card Game(s) (one per group)
* Blank cards or pre-prepared story cards

**Required material for the participants**:
None

**Ideal setting**:
One large table or one table per group

**Steps**:

* introduction to the data visualization and its uses (explanatory or exploratory). Examples of a various uses of data visualization in news media (1h30)
simple matching game: 5 scenarios. Rate of unemployment. If you have to visualise, pick the right card. They have to imagine the data table, then draw the graph (e.g. bar graph) (30mn)
* bar charts on infogram. Result of a hypothesis and question that they did the way before. They have to remphasise how the data has to be ordered to visualise the data. (2h)
* the next morning they were given all the game cards. Groups of the 3. Each group researched the forms they didn't know and put the definitions in a Google Doc. They prepared a presentation of the one they found the most challenging to understand and show how it was used in the media. (found out that they didn't really understand ). 1h30.
* the cards are put on the table(s) and the groups are encouraged to explore them, looking at the front and back, asking questions about visualizations they don’t know (15mn)
* the rules of the game are explained (5mn) :
     * the workshop facilitator will read ‘story’ cards aloud, with each story cards asking participants to find the visualizations which fit the task
     * each group will have a limited time (around 3mn) browse the set of cards on their table, discussing and selecting the card which fit the task
     * once the time is up, the groups should raise the cards they have chosen in the air until the facilitator comes to their table and validate or invalidate their choice.
     * Each ‘perfect fit’ gives +1 point to the group. Each wrong card gives -1. Ambiguous choices, where the visualization fits technically but would be misleading in real use give 0 points.
     * Points are tallied through all rounds of story cards and the winning group is the one with the most points
the game takes place (1h)
     * debriefing about lessons learned and tools that help create visualizations (10mn)

**Pre-workshop evaluation**:

* have you already produced data visualizations?
* what are the main visualizations you know?

**Post-workshop evaluation**:

* Do you understand better the logic behind datavisualisation?
*Do you feel like you could create your own story card with your own data?
