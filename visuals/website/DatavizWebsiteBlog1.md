# Welcome to the Dataviz Card Game !

Through this blog the Dataviz Card Game team will share some insights in the process and thinking behind the development of the game and its assets. This is also for us an exercise in documenting everything, making it easier to adapt or tweak the project in the future.

This blog will also be used as a repository of meeting notes and workshop reports, making it easy for you to see any development of the project.
