## Dataviz Cards

The Dataviz cards are at the core of the Dataviz Card Game experience. They include the most common data visualisations on the front side, with their respective uses on the back side. They can be used on their own - with the [Dataviz Discovery Workshop]() for example - or in conjunction with story cards. 

## Story Cards

The Story cards set contains severals examples of story along three themes: Traffic Accidents, Domestic Violence and Air Pollution. Story cards, use in conjunction with the Dataviz cards, are a great way to brainstorm the best visualisation to explore or visualise data on a specific topic. Even though we provide a card template, they can be made of anything: post-its, sheets of paper, or anything you can write on!

## Facilitator guide

The Facilitator guide provides context and guidance on the uses of Dataviz Card games for educational or project planning workshops. Several workshop examples are also provided. Use this to prepare your own workshop or get inspiration to create new formats!

## DIY instructions.

Getting your own Dataviz Card Game set is just a matter of printing and cutting. But if youâ€™re unsure about the process, we go you covered.
